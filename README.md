# Decision Under Uncertainty: A Practical Guide to Making Better Choices with Incomplete Information

## üìö About This Book

Every day, we make decisions without knowing what will happen next. From career moves to medical choices, from investments to relationships, we must choose despite uncertainty. Yet most of us have never been taught how to make decisions systematically.

This book changes that. Drawing on cutting-edge research from cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and philosophy, it provides practical frameworks for navigating uncertainty with greater skill and confidence.
